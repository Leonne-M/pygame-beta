# Poker Game

This game is built as a pass time terminal experience.We all agrred on this exactly because it seemed like a fun way of testing knowledge that we have obtained through different classes and learning material obtained through our time in Moringa school.

## Setup

In order to get this game you need to clone the folder from our github repo and run the file from the gameloop.py file.

## More

The game is played by two people the player and the cpu.The player makes a move and the cpu itself picks a random move that it can play(not the best move yet) because it is not fully coded this issue is to be adressed in the later versions of the game.Along with better coding the cpu we will also be adressing some notified bugs that need to be worked on.
